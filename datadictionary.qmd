## Variable Definitions

This data dictionary reflects variables retained after filtering and cleaning two Catapult datasets from Seasons 1 and 2, excluding player-specific entries and separating game vs. practice data.

| Variable Name               | Operational Definition                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Date`                     | The calendar date of the session. Converted to a datetime format and sorted per player. |
| `Season`                   | Indicates which dataset the session came from (either "Season 1" or "Season 2").        |
| `About`                    | The athlete’s full name. Used to track individual session data; one player removed.     |
| `Position`                 | The athlete’s listed basketball position (e.g., Guard, Forward, Center).                |
| `Period Number`            | Numerical label representing a segment of time during a session (e.g., quarter number). |
| `Period`                   | Text description of a session segment (e.g., "Period 1", "Skill Work").                 |
| `Total Player Load`        | Overall workload calculated from accelerometer data; reflects cumulative movement.      |
| `Player Load Per Minute`   | Average physical load per minute played. Normalizes `Total Player Load` by time.       |
| `IMA Accel High`           | Count of high-intensity accelerations, such as fast breaks or hard cuts.               |
| `IMA Jump Count High Band` | Count of jumps in the highest effort band (e.g., blocks, dunks, rebounds).             |
| `Session Total Jumps`      | Total number of jumps captured by the sensor during a session.                         |

## Notes

- The dataset was cleaned by removing duplicates, excluding one player ("Ben Vander Plas"), and filtering by `Position` and `Period`.
- Game data was identified by rows where the `Period` string included the word "period" (e.g., "Period 1", "Period 2").
- Practice data was identified by exclusion of those `Period` labels.

Sensor data was sourced from Catapult and reflects a mixture of accelerometer and jump-based metrics, used to monitor workload and readiness.
